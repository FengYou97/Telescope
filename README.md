# [Telescope: A ReactJS Based Starlink Trajectory Visualization Tool](https://dev1164.d1vpszzdy99vr3.amplifyapp.com/)

Telescope is a JavaScript application that retrieves Satrlink satellite location coordiantes from [N2YO](https://www.n2yo.com/) API and visualizes the satelite trajectory over an observation point.

- Designed and developed a visualization tool using **ReactJS** and **D3** to monitor satellites in real-time based on geo-location.
- Implemented location, altitude, and duration-based selectors to refine satellite search.
- **Visualized** selected satellite paths on a world man using D3 to improve the user experience.
- Deployed the dashboard to Amazon Web Services for demonstration.
